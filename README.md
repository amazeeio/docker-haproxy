# amazee.io docker images

This is a master repo for a collection of amazee.io-maintained docker images, mostly used in the [pygmy](https://github.com/amazeeio/pygmy) and [pygmy-go](https://github.com/fubarhouse/pygmy-go) local development tools

Each image is is fully self-contained in a folder, and there is a github action to build and publish them all together.

The `latest` tag should be used with pygmy and pygmy-go unless testing ahead (or behind).
